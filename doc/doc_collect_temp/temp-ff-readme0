This directory contains the C implementation of Metric-FF, as it was
used in the 3rd international planning competition. Build the planner
by typing

make

Which produces an executable named

FF_X

Usage should be self-explanatory. Running ff without any parameters
prints out a brief help information about the parameters that are
applicable, which basically come down to specifying the domain and
problem files.

Have fun,

Joerg Hoffmann

//**************************************************//
run() is the function which wrapped the main() function of FF_X

//------------------------------------------------//
1.
Usage of FF_X(shell):

A example here:

./FF_X -p './' -a 'output.txt' -o 'domain.pddl' -f 'probBLOCKS-4-0.pddl'


Then, go to the current directory, find "output.txt",it contains the output of FF_X.
2.
Usage of FF_X.run()  ---->wrapped func

A example here:


>>import FF_X

>>argv = ['./','-a','output.txt','-o','domain.pddl','-f','probBLOCKS-4-0.pddl']

>>FF_X.run(argv)

Then, go to the current directory, find "output.txt",it contains the output of FF_X.
