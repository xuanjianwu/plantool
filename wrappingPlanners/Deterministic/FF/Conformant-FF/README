This directory contains the C implementation of Metric-FF, as it was
used in the 3rd international planning competition. Build the planner
by typing

make

Which produces an executable named

Conf_FF

Usage should be self-explanatory. Running ff without any parameters
prints out a brief help information about the parameters that are
applicable, which basically come down to specifying the domain and
problem files.

Have fun,

Joerg Hoffmann


/**************************************************/
Usage of Conformant-FF:

OPTIONS   DESCRIPTIONS

-p <str>    path for operator and fact file
-a <str>    path for output file
-o <str>    operator file name
-f <str>    fact file name

-h <num>    heuristic function to be used (preset: 1) (explanation: see journal paper)
      0     implication graph for path to s plus RPG, incomplete check for leafs implication by I
      1     implication graph for path to s plus RPG, complete check for leafs implication by I
      2     implication graph for RPG, complete check for leafs implication by phi(s)

-E          EHC run OFF
-H          helpful actions OFF

-S          stagnating paths check OFF
-D          full repeated (dominated) states check OFF

-B          run Best-first search in breadth-first style

-M          manual search control
-d <num>    debug info level (preset 0)
-R          debug relax.c
-A          debug search.c
-T          debug state_transitions.cpp
//**************************************************//


run() is the function which wrapped the main() function of FF_X

//------------------------------------------------//
1.
Usage of Conf_FF(shell):

A example here:

./Conf_FF -p './' -a 'output.txt' -o 'domain.pddl' -f 'probBLOCKS-4-0.pddl'


Then, go to the current directory, find "output.txt",it contains the output of Conf_FF.
2.
Usage ofConf_FF.run()  ---->wrapped func

A example here:


>>import Conf_FF

>>argv = ['./','-a','output.txt','-o','domain.pddl','-f','probBLOCKS-4-0.pddl']

>>Conf_FF.run(argv)

Then, go to the current directory, find "output.txt",it contains the output of FF_X.
